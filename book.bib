 abstractNote={The use of biomarkers as early warning systems in the evaluation of disease risk has increased markedly in the last decade. Biomarkers are indicators of typical biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological reactions to therapy. The application and identification of biomarkers in the medical and clinical fields have an enormous impact on society. In this review, we discuss the history, various definitions, classifications, characteristics, and discovery of biomarkers. Furthermore, the potential application of biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various diseases over the last decade are reviewed. The present review aims to inspire readers to explore new avenues in biomarker research and development.},
