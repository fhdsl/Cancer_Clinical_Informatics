 abstractNote={The use of biomarkers as early warning systems in the evaluation of disease risk has increased markedly in the last decade. Biomarkers are indicators of typical biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological reactions to therapy. The application and identification of biomarkers in the medical and clinical fields have an enormous impact on society. In this review, we discuss the history, various definitions, classifications, characteristics, and discovery of biomarkers. Furthermore, the potential application of biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various diseases over the last decade are reviewed. The present review aims to inspire readers to explore new avenues in biomarker research and development.},

  abstractNote={Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) are conducted during routine clinical care and have the potential to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of interventions under real world conditions. However, many pragmatic trials rely on data from the electronic health record (EHR) data, which are subject to bias from incomplete data, poor data quality, lack of representation from people who are medically underserved, and implicit bias in EHR design. This commentary examines how the use of EHR data might exacerbate bias and potentially increase health inequities. We offer recommendations for how to increase generalizability of ePCT results and begin to mitigate bias to promote health equity.},

  abstractNote={Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) play a vital role in addressing current population health problems, and their use of electronic health record (EHR) systems promises efficiencies that will increase the speed and volume of relevant and generalizable research. However, as the number of ePCTs using EHR-derived data grows, so does the risk that research will become more vulnerable to biases due to differences in data capture and access to care for different subsets of the population, thereby propagating inequities in health and the healthcare system. We identify 3 challenges—incomplete and variable capture of data on social determinants of health, lack of representation of vulnerable populations that do not access or receive treatment, and data loss due to variable use of technology—that exacerbate bias when working with EHR data and offer recommendations and examples of ways to actively mitigate bias.},
